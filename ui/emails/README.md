## Email templates

These email templates are generated using [MJML](https://mjml.io/). It may be
helpful to add an [IDE extension](https://documentation.mjml.io/#development) to
aid in development.

## Build templates

All templates in the `mjml` directory can be built by running the following command:

```
make build
```

This will build all templates to the `internal/mail/html` directory and sync the
images.
